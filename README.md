A performance optimization mod for Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server (BDS), "LeviOptimize" is designed to enhance server performance by addressing issues related to low ticks per second (TPS). Operating within the LeviLamina framework, it modifies BDS code to achieve notable performance improvements.

## Installation

### Using Lip

```sh
lip install github.com/LiteLDev/LeviOptimize
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LeviOptimize/releases).
2. Unpack the `LeviOptimize-windows-x64.zip` file.
3. Copy the `LeviOptimize` folder to the `mods` folder of your BDS installation directory.

## Usage

Upon its first run, LeviOptimize will generate configuration files in `mod/LeviOptimize/config/`. These files are customizable to tailor the mod's behavior to your needs.

## Commands

- **`timing`**: Displays server performance statistics, focusing on TPS and detailed ECS performance metrics.

> **Note**: If your application crashes immediately upon using the `timing` command, with the exception pointing to a null pointer, please check the version of your msvcp140.dll. Consider updating or repairing the Visual C++ Redistributable, or simply copy a working msvcp140.dll file from a functioning device to your BDS root directory.

## Features

- **`optHopperItem`**: Enhances TPS by optimizing item transfers between hoppers and containers.
- **`optMovingBlock`**: Improves FPS and TPS by optimizing block entities' processing during piston movements.
- **`fixChunkLeak`**: Addresses the issue of chunks remaining loaded after players leave.
- **`optSeenPercent`**: Caches "SeenPercent" values to improve TPS, with a note of caution regarding potential hash collisions.
- **`optPacketSender`**: Optimizes the packet sending process to improve server performance.
  >Some mods rely on this feature to achieve multi-threaded sending packets, it is best to keep it enabled.
- **`optPlayerLookup`**: Optimizes the `Level::getPlayer` method to improve player lookup performance.
- **`optPushEntity`**: Improves server performance by reducing TPS drops from entity cramming with two key options:

  - `disableVec0Push`: Stops entities from being squeezed when their collision vector is zero, enhancing performance without altering gameplay significantly.

  - `maxPushTimes`: Sets a limit on the number of times entities can be pushed per tick, with `-1` indicating this limit is disabled by default. Adjust carefully to avoid negatively impacting gameplay.

  - `unlimitedPlayerPush`: No longer limit the pushes related to players, and it is only effect when the `maxPushTimes` is enabled.
